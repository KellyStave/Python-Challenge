# Python-Challenge
For this challenge I found Python to be more difficult to navigate than Excel, not surprising I guess (I don't like snakes!)
I had some issues initially opening the csv files, once open I discovered the importance of the indent to the looping process. 
Last was writing the files to the analysis folder, this proved to be the most challenging for me. First the text was one long string, then came the quotation marks to
try and make the lines appear on separate lines. All in all just glad this challenge is complete.
